# Krittin "Yim" Jindamai — Aerospace Engineering Portfolio

Static site for GitHub Pages. Plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step, relative paths
only. Dev-only context; safe to delete before publishing. Audience: professors
he's applying to work with — it must read as credible and technical, skim fast,
and link straight to specific projects.
**Keep this file under 300 lines.** Necessary information only — load-bearing
decisions, rules Krittin set, traps that have already caused bugs. Detailed
rationale belongs beside the code. When something is superseded, delete the
old passage rather than writing beside it.

## Local dev

ES modules mean **`file://` will not work** — serve over HTTP (`npx serve .`).
Three.js r160 comes from unpkg via the import map in `index.html`'s `<head>`
(required — `OrbitControls.js` imports the bare specifier `"three"`), so both
3D scenes need a connection.

**Do not start a server or open a browser to verify changes** — Krittin checks
visually himself and it loads his laptop. Reason about the code, state the
numbers and the viewport they assume, and say plainly what is unverified.

## Design system — "Factory" + space theme

Dark, flat, instrument-panel. **The UI itself is flat**: no shadows, glow, blur,
gradients, or emoji. Depth comes from contrast, hairlines and spacing.

**Colors** (hexes in `style.css`) — `--void`/`--void-edge` (backdrop),
`--obsidian`/`--carbon` (raised surfaces), `--ash` (hairlines), `--graphite`,
`--warm-granite`, `--pale-stone`, `--bone` (text), `--chalk` — the four mid
greys also underlie the 3D models' per-facet shading (`shadeByNormal`, each
model multiplying through its own tint). **`--orange`/`--green` stay
functional accents only**, never a model — just the two trajectories.
**Type** — Space Grotesk (400/500/600) headings/body; JetBrains Mono for labels/nav/mono data.
**Rules** — radii 3px buttons/nav, 10px cards, 999px pills, 20px panels; 1px
hairline borders, never shadows; 120px section rhythm (80px under 900px);
`--t-fast`/`--t-mid` on `--ease` for feedback, `--t-slow` on `--ease-out` for
entrances; eyebrows uppercase mono 12px with a small orange status dot.
**Depth exception** — two places only, because fully flat read as dull: the
backdrop (`.nebula` at 38% × `--sky-color`, three achromatic parallaxing star
layers, rare meteors) and the two 3D scenes. Nothing in the UI glows.
**`--sky-color`** is scroll-driven by `main.js`: full over the hero, draining
to 0 across the descent, back to `PROJECT_SKY` (0.8) for Projects and held
through Awards; detail pages set it to 0.
**Motion** — every animation must be skippable: honour `prefers-reduced-motion`
in CSS (block at the end of `style.css`) and JS (`REDUCED` in each file), and
prefer motion that *means* something over generic fades.

## Site structure

One page: `home` → `about` → `experience` → `projects` → `awards`.

- **Education/Skills are not sections** — Education is a list at the end of
  About's middle column; Skills is the vertical marquee in its right column
  (keeps `#skills` for deep links, out of the nav). Nav is five items:
  home/about/experience/projects/awards — the hero's fourth cubesat points at
  `#awards`, and **its `id` must equal the section id** (`onSelect` scrolls to
  `"#" + id`). **The nav order is duplicated in all seven `projects/` files.**
- **About is three columns** (portrait / bio+education / marquee), widening
  `.section-inner` to 1560px (Experience matches); the rest stay at 1200.
  Every section is `min-height: calc(100vh - 64px)`, content flex-centred —
  **`.section-inner` needs explicit `width: 100%`**, or a flex item with
  `margin: 0 auto` shrinks to content instead of stretching. Experience is six
  hairline rows inverting to a light panel on hover (`grid-template-rows:
  0fr -> 1fr`); no hover below 900px, so detail stays open.

## Page behavior (`js/main.js`)

- **Scrolling** — native smooth is off; eased scroll 620–1150ms scaled by
  distance, cancelled on user scroll, exposed as `window.smoothScrollTo`.
  `NAV_H = 64`. `[data-reveal]` settles in on intersection (`="left"` from the
  side), siblings staggered 90ms, capped at 5.
- **Nav** — active link decided once per observer callback, not per entry, or
  two sections fight over it. Links are absolutely centred (`left:50%;
  top:50%`, both explicit); below 900px they revert to the right-hand end.
- **Starfield** — three layers moved by `background-position` (not transform)
  so tiling stays seamless; depths 0.04/0.10/0.20. Meteor every 7–19s.
- **Nebula** — parallax 0.006 clamped ±30px, drift (96px/~69s x, 48px/~94s y),
  scale breathe (~41s, 1.285–1.395). **Judge these in px/sec, not amplitude**
  (sine peaks at 2πA/T): frozen twice under ~1 px/s, it's ~8.7 px/s now — the
  breathe is what makes it cloud, not a panned texture. 34% CSS overscale
  hides the edges — **raise it before raising these**. Reduced motion leaves
  transform unset so `transform:none` wins.
- **Descent** — one scroll handler publishes `--descent`/`window.__descentP`,
  `window.__risePx` and `--sky-color` as globals (not callbacks), because
  **`main.js` loads from `<head>`, render-blocking** — the scenes come later,
  but `pagereveal` fires at first render, so these must already be set.

## The descent — home, about and experience over one scene

Scrolling from the hero into About is a camera move, not a section break: the
globe is pinned across all three sections and the camera flies in until its
limb lies across the foot of About as a horizon. **One leg** — progress runs
0→1 over the hero's own height, so low orbit arrives as About's top meets the
nav, costing no extra scroll length.

- **Past the horizon the globe rides the scroll**, not the camera —
  `window.__risePx`, a pixel offset applied 1:1, **deliberately not eased**
  (lag reads as sliding against the content). Must stop exactly where the
  sticky scene unpins, or the two add up and the globe leaves at double speed
  (`main.js` derives that from `.descent`'s box); don't re-add camera motion.
- **The globe stays interactive at every scroll position** — drag, hover,
  labels, click-to-navigate, never gated on scroll; it's navigation, not
  ornament. `HORIZON_Y` (0.70, matched by `--horizon-band`) dials how much
  planet is on screen.
- **Pinning** — `#home`/`#about`/`#experience` share one `.descent` wrapper
  with `.hero-scene` as its sticky first child (Experience is in it because
  the canvas is clipped to its own box). Scene sized to the band under the nav
  (`top: 64px; height: calc(100vh - 64px)`) but keeping its full flow height —
  a sticky element releases at its margin box, so the usual negative-margin
  trick would pin it a screen too long — with the hero pulled back over it via
  `margin-top: calc(-100vh + 64px)`. The three sections are
  `pointer-events: none`, content taking it back, or they eat drags.
- **No descent below 900px or under reduced motion** (needs `left:0;right:0`,
  or sticky→absolute drops the auto width and the canvas collapses to zero);
  the scene has no `view-transition-name`.

## Page transitions

`@view-transition { navigation: auto; }`, cross-document, no JS. `.nebula`,
`.stars`, `.topnav` and `footer` carry `view-transition-name`s so the chrome
holds still and navigation reads as content swapping inside a fixed frame —
the single change that most improved it; do not fold them back in.

- **Motion is directional** — `main.js` sets `data-vt="forward"|"back"` on
  `<html>` before the snapshot, on **both** documents. Backdrop offsets carry
  over via `sessionStorage` (`krj-backdrop`), persisted on `pagehide`, painted
  synchronously on load — a late restore shows as a jump.
- **Shared-element morph is title-only** — `cardFor()` returns null for the
  Projects scene (it cross-fades; a 3D canvas can't be snapshotted). **Never
  put `data-reveal` on `.detail-header`/`.detail-media`** — it leaves them at
  `opacity: 0` when the snapshot is taken and the morph lands on nothing.
  Fallback is a 200ms exit-only fade, off under reduced motion.

## Home hero (`js/orbit-scene.js`)

Left third: name (types on), "(Yim)", title, focus line, live status strip,
numbered links. Right two-thirds: the 3D scene.

- **The globe is a cartographic instrument, not a photoreal planet** —
  posterised elevation, hairline coastline, flat ice caps (`abs(n.y)` kept
  high, 0.938 ≈ 20° cap), quantised terminator. **No glow anywhere**; the
  atmosphere is a billboarded hairline limb ring at `GLOBE_R * 1.075`.
  Continents bake ONCE into a 2048×1024 target — don't move that noise back
  into the per-frame shader.
- **The canvas is full-bleed across hero, About and Experience** (it used to be
  boxed in `.hero-right`, slicing cubesats in half); it reads right-of-centre
  because the frustum is offset (`SCENE_CENTER_WIDE` 0.68). **No lights at
  all** — six fixed per-face fills on the 4 cubesats, mid-grey not near-black,
  or they read as holes in the planet. `buildCubesat()` is also the Projects
  scene's satellite.
- **Hover is recomputed every frame from the stored pointer position**, not
  `pointerenter`/`pointerleave` — that sticks under a stationary cursor.

## Projects — the Earth/Moon system (`js/system-scene.js`)

Index order is **by year, most recent first, Lunar Hopper always last** (both
Krittin's). Order lives only in `index.html`'s `.proj-index`; `system-scene.js`
matches rows to objects by href, so reordering needs no change there.

| Project | Year | File | Model / where |
|---|---|---|---|
| Non Holonomic CBF | 2026 | `ros-research.html` | TurtleBot at Earth's limb |
| Hybrid CMG Desaturation | 2026 | `thesis.html` | the hero's satellite, between the bodies |
| Project TerraGator | 2026 | `rocket-airbrake.html` | Space Shuttle, outbound climb |
| Project Navigator | 2025 | `rocket-software.html` | SLS, on the way home |
| Sky Crane | 2025 | `controls-final-project.html` | octagonal deck + 4 thrusters, hovering |
| Lunar Hopper | 2026, in progress | `senior-design-project.html` | the hop arc off the south pole |

**TerraGator is the airbrake page, Navigator the software one** — the opposite
of the alphabetical guess. **Filenames have never changed and must not**
through two renames, to avoid breaking links.
The camera never moves; everything sits in a design frame of `(fx, fy)`
fractions `resize()` contain-fits. `LAYOUTS` (three presets by aspect) places
the bodies/satellite; `framePos`'s `k` is real perspective, not fudge.
**Judge spacing in SCREEN space, not world distance** — Navigator sits ~0.76
units behind the plane, so world (1.35 vs 1.16) and screen (449px vs 175px,
what Krittin saw) disagree; `cmg` keeps midpoint **fx**, raises **fy** till equidistant.

- **Earth is a whole globe** — the canvas runs 68% taller than its section
  (`--scene-spill`), so the lower half carries on behind Awards; `resize()`
  still solves preset/fit/camera against the *section* height, keeping Earth
  the same size and place. **The `--scene-spill: 1.68` override must sit AFTER
  the `1` default** — a media query adds no specificity, and putting it earlier
  once silently broke it. `.awards` needs `position:relative; z-index:1` (no
  background) to paint in front of the planet.
- **The index is TWO `.proj-index` navs** sharing the class (so
  `initIndexTyping()`/href-matching still see one six-row list) — top-left
  **Research** (CBF, CMG) in the ~26%×46% corner, bottom-right **Projects**
  (the other four), UNVERIFIED against the Moon-side composition, 39px
  (**1.5x**, up from 26). Row = title + year + optional `.proj-status`/
  `.proj-program`; only the title types, the rest fade in. CBF, CMG, Lunar
  Hopper carry "in progress"; Lunar Hopper's year is the real 2026.
- **Models are SOLID, not wireframes**, each its own muted colour (never
  `--orange`/`--green`, reserved for the flight paths; a `*_TINT` const per
  model) with per-facet opacity (`FILL_ALPHA_STEPS`, ~0.14–0.5), not flat.
  `shadeByNormal()` bakes tone+alpha per vertex on the MERGED geometry — the
  hero's per-face material ARRAY won't work here (`applyFade` needs one).
- **Three models have a preferred roll** or read as a stick/bare tube —
  shuttle/SLS keep identifying features in local XY, `park()` rolls that
  plane toward camera (`TERRAGATOR_ROLL`/`NAVIGATOR_ROLL`); satellite gets an
  explicit basis (not `setFromUnitVectors`, one axis only) plus `SAT_ROLL`.
- **`EDGE_CLEAN` is 32°** — a 12-gon's 30° seams vanish, a 10-gon's 36° draw.
  Cylinders/cones want ≥12, except **Sky Crane's deck**: octagon, 45°, deliberate.
- **One continuous flight-path line**, half-bright orange (`dim(ORANGE,0.5)`
  on colour, not opacity — opacity lets the starfield through), wrapping the
  Moon but not Earth, not closed into a loop. Outbound's hand-placed
  (`OUTBOUND_CONTROL`); homebound derives from the wrap tangent (`sign=-1`).
  Lunar Hopper's green arc is the loudest line — don't add a path unasked.
- **Hover opens `.proj-info`** instead of navigating — anchored next to the
  model itself (`updateInfoPanel()`, inline `left`/`right`/`top`, not a
  canvas-edge dock; `INFO_MOBILE_MQ` skips it under 900px, inline beats the
  bottom-sheet media query otherwise). Touch: a MODEL tap opens it, a second
  (or its link) navigates. `desc` is each page's real title, never fabricated.
- **`.proj-label` (16px/bone) is pushed off Earth's/Moon's disc** by
  `clearBody()` if `dx`/`dy` would sit it on one (`avoidEarth`/`avoidMoon`,
  off for whichever body the object stands ON). Nudges are a prefix of the
  text ("as far as 'nav'"), so `dx` derives from mono's 0.6em, not pixels.
- **`EARTH_YAW` is chosen at runtime** — a 128×64 bake scored for green land
  facing camera, becomes `earthSpin`'s rest rotation (arrival settles *onto*
  it, not 0). `EARTH_TILT_X` (−45°)/`MOON_TILT_X` (−35°) decide which pole
  faces where.
- **TurtleBot stands at Earth's LIMB, not on the disc** — `robotWant`'s
  toward-camera component (0.18) is the dial (~80° off view direction);
  below ~0.12 it crosses to the far side and floats. `greenestNear`'s green
  tie-break is 0.0004 — at 0.0015 a texel ~20° away could win, ruinous here.
- **Far field (Sun/Saturn/Mars) removed** — "just make nebula the thing that
  slowly changes." Earth's cloud shell is the only moving part and the only
  reason there's a render loop (`DRIFT_FPS` 24, visible-only, off reduced).
- Build each body *before* its graticule/limb/surface, or draw order breaks.
  Every path is a flat `Line2` — its `LineMaterial` needs `resolution` set,
  and `resize()` walks `isLineMaterial` **after** `applyLayout`.
- **Section sizing:** edge to edge, one screen above 900px, `flex-start` not
  `center` (center + hard height overflows both ends). Mobile: 70vh scene,
  index under it. `ROBOT_DROP` scales with `ROBOT_SCALE`. Separate scene from
  the hero — Krittin turned the continuous-globe version down.

## Content status — do not fabricate any of this

Placeholders are marked in brackets; leave them until Krittin supplies content.

- **About** — bio real (his own words: Thailand/GISTDA origin, research
  interests/experience/thesis); photo real, uncropped (`aspect-ratio:548/900`,
  height varies with it). **Education & coursework (real):** `.about-edu-row`
  puts education LEFT, coursework RIGHT; `.edu-detail` is `--pale-stone`,
  education's year its own line not "· year". **Awards:** VBU, Dean's List, Honors, UFIC.
- **Experience** — all 7 rows real, no `.exp-summary`. Order: CBF, then Space
  Systems Group (SSG). "Swamp Launch Rocketry Team (Swamplaunch)" reconstructs
  a message that came through blanked — UNVERIFIED, confirm the wording.
- **Projects** — years are real (table above). Research pages
  (`_template-research.html`: PI/department/duration/tools/focus/
  responsibility, a paper+code CTA) have real content on CBF (**university
  scholars program**) and CMG (**undergraduate honors thesis**) — tagged on
  their page, in `PROJECTS`' hover `desc`, and in the index (`.proj-program`,
  own line via `flex-wrap`). Build pages don't normally get a paper link —
  **Sky Crane is the exception**: a real class PDF (`controls-final-
  project.pdf`) Krittin asked to link, its overview/approach/results is
  AI-written FROM that PDF, and 2 of its 3 results plots are now real
  exports (`crane-linsim-result.png`/`-nonlinsim-result.png`) — only
  pole-placement is still simulated fresh from the PDF's poles/K-matrix
  (not an export, illustrative only, flag as needing his read-through).
  TerraGator/Navigator/Sky Crane otherwise use whatever
  `.desc` header breakdown Krittin gave, not a fixed overview/approach/
  results. Lunar Hopper untouched. thesis.html's
  lead media + `.cmg-charts` are live off `assets/data/`/`js/cmg-scene.js`.
  **TerraGator and Navigator have real photos/video now** — a background-
  removed floating cutout row (`.cutout-row`/`.cutout`, no card, per-image
  aspect not a fixed box — "must see the entire model not image cutoff";
  `.is-xl` doubles a cutout's height cap, on Navigator's rocket) plus one lead
  `.detail-media` (TerraGator: `assets/video/terragator.mp4`, muted,
  JS-delayed `.play()` 1s after load; Navigator: the retention-system photo).
  `.detail-figure--plain` drops the carbon/ash box for Navigator's flight-log
  results. Higgsfield's free credits are at 0; local PowerShell/
  `System.Drawing` chroma-keying is the fallback — decontaminate edge colors
  (not just threshold alpha), or soft edges halo against a dark background.
- **Skills marquee** — duplicated in the markup; edit both copies. Resume,
  LinkedIn and GitHub links are all real now.

## Generated assets

Decorative, non-representational assets only (background textures) may use the
Higgsfield MCP connector. **Project descriptions, experience entries and his
headshot must never be generated or invented.** Check `balance` and preflight
with `get_cost: true` (free-plan, credits scarce). Take the compressed
`minUrl` WebP, not the raw PNG (50 KB vs 6.4 MB), into `assets/images/`,
referenced relatively so it resolves from root and `projects/` both.
