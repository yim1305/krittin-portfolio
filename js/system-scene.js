// ==========================================================================
// Projects — the Earth/Moon system.
//
// One FIXED 3D scene holding all six projects at their designated places,
// replacing the old rotating-Moon scene (js/moon-scene.js, kept on disk as
// the revert path but no longer imported). Krittin's brief, and his sketch:
// Earth cropped by the bottom-left corner, the Moon fully visible on the
// right, and every project sitting where it belongs in that system —
//
//   CBF TurtleBot ............ standing on Earth's surface
//   Hybrid CMG satellite ..... between the flight path's two legs
//   Project TerraGator ....... Space Shuttle, on the outbound climb
//   Project Navigator ........ SLS, on the way home
//   Sky Crane ................ landed on the Moon's surface
//   Lunar Hopper ............. the hop arc off the Moon's south pole
//
// FIVE OF THE SIX ARE JUST OBJECTS NOW. The scene used to draw a trajectory
// for each of four of them; all four are gone, and only the Lunar Hopper's arc
// survives, because that project has no model and the line IS its object. See
// the block further down where they used to be described.
//
// The two rockets sit on ONE continuous flyby: out from Earth, a wrap around
// the Moon that passes in front of it on one side and behind it on the other,
// then home again. Krittin: "make the trajectory of the rocket line go around
// the moon, and connect to the one from earth as well like a passby."
//
// ALMOST NOTHING MOVES. No orbiting, no self-spin, no camera drift, no
// OrbitControls — Krittin: "keep it static for now, lets get the design
// pretty and every model looks good with camera angle and the scene first."
// The single exception is Earth's cloud shell, which he asked for afterwards.
//
// That exception costs more than it looks like it should, and it is worth
// knowing why. This scene was designed with NO requestAnimationFrame loop at
// all: it rendered once on arrival, again on each resize, and then cost
// exactly nothing while it sat on screen. Drifting clouds means re-rendering
// the whole scene, so the loop is back. It is kept on the tightest leash that
// still looks right — visible-only, throttled well under display rate, and
// skipped entirely under prefers-reduced-motion. See the arrival section at
// the bottom. Do not add any FURTHER continuous motion without a reason worth
// that trade; this is a second WebGL context on a page that already runs a
// full-screen scene.
//
// Everything else follows the house style unchanged, and most of it is
// lifted from js/orbit-scene.js and js/moon-scene.js rather than reinvented:
// posterised elevation bands instead of gradients, a hairline at the
// coast/mare boundary, a hairline limb ring instead of any glow, a graticule
// with an orange equator kept on top of the solid surface, a terminator
// quantised to four flat steps, one shared light DIRECTION and NO LIGHTS IN
// THE SCENE AT ALL. Paths are flat screen-space Line2 ribbons, never 3D tube
// geometry — see flatLine() for why that matters.
//
// ---- how the composition is placed ------------------------------------
//
// The camera never moves, so rather than hand-tuning world coordinates,
// every object is placed against a DESIGN FRAME: a rectangle FRAME_W x
// FRAME_H world units, at the depth of the Earth/Moon plane, which is
// guaranteed to be fully visible. Positions inside it are given as plain
// (fx, fy) fractions — (0,0) top-left, (1,1) bottom-right — exactly like the
// --x/--y percentages the old CSS scatter field used, which is why the
// numbers below can be read straight off the sketch.
//
// Three layout presets cover the range of canvas aspects (see LAYOUTS).
// They exist because one composition cannot serve both a 1.9:1 desktop band
// and a 0.5:1 phone: on a portrait canvas the Moon has to sit ABOVE Earth
// rather than beside it. Switching preset repositions the two bodies and
// rebuilds the two flight arcs; everything else is parented to a body and
// follows for free.
//
// The arcs are the one thing NOT specified in frame fractions, because they
// span between the two bodies and would need re-deriving per preset. They
// are given in an axis-relative frame instead — s along Earth->Moon, h
// perpendicular to it, c toward the camera, all in units of the Earth-Moon
// separation — so one table of numbers works in all three layouts.
//
// UNVERIFIED: none of the framing arithmetic below has been checked in a
// browser (standing instruction not to run the site). The screen positions
// quoted in the comments are computed for the WIDE preset at a 1440x740
// canvas. Check them by eye before trusting any of them further.

// is its upper right — which, at a 23.4-degree tilt, was showing the north ice
// cap, and a hard white plate is exactly the wrong note against posterised

//
// Moon: -35 degrees about X does the opposite job. At +17 degrees of camera
// elevation the true south pole faces slightly AWAY, and the Lunar Hopper arc
// has to start there (Krittin: "same line on moon south pole"). The tilt
// brings it back round to the near side so the hop leaves where you can see it.
//
// Both are X-only, deliberately: surface directions are converted through

// EARTH IS NO LONGER CROPPED BY THE BOTTOM OF THE SECTION. Its centre is still
// below the design frame — that has not changed and must not, the composition
// depends on it — but the canvas now runs taller than the section it sits in,
// so the lower half of the globe carries on behind Awards instead of being
// sliced off by a hard straight edge. Krittin: "dont crop off earth maek erth
// a full globe (keep it where it is, the bottom half just be on the awards
// page)". See --scene-spill in css/style.css and the spill note in resize():
// the frame, the preset choice and the camera are all still solved against the
// SECTION-visible height, which is what keeps Earth at the same size and in
// the same place while more of it becomes visible.
//
// The Moon's y in each was nudged down a few points ("move moon down just a
// tiny bit"), which also bought headroom above it for the flight path's entry
// and for Sky Crane's label.
//
// `cmg` keeps the midpoint's fx but is RAISED off the Earth-Moon line —
// Krittin: the middle "is good, but also need to be equally spaced between the
// 2 rockets (rn its too low and too close to the SLS)".
//
// He was right, and the imbalance was much worse than it looked in world
// coordinates: at the plain midpoint the satellite was 449px from TerraGator
// and 175px from Navigator on a 1440x740 canvas. WORLD distance said 1.35 vs
// 1.16, which is nearly balanced — the discrepancy is Navigator sitting ~0.76
// units BEHIND the Earth/Moon plane, so it is far away in 3D and close in
// projection. **Judge this in screen space; world distance will mislead you.**
//
// Raising fy to 0.558 on the wide preset lands 286px vs 285px — properly
// equidistant. That works out to 0.484 world units up, which is almost exactly
// one of the satellite's own apparent heights (he estimated one and a half).
//
// The two narrower presets CANNOT reach equidistant: fx is fixed at the
// midpoint and moving up walks the satellite straight into the Moon, which in
// those layouts sits much closer relative to the frame. Their values are the
// highest that still keep ~0.15 world units of clearance past the Moon's limb
// ring, so they improve the balance without colliding rather than solving it.

// line that circles around both earth and moon, idk what that line is for."
// That round also removed the Moon wrap along with it, but that went too far
// — the very next round asked for it back: "the old line used to look more
// like a trajectory that wraps around the moon, bring that back." So the
// Earth wrap stays gone, but the Moon wrap (`moonWrap` in buildFlight below)
// is back, and it is stitched into ONE line with the outbound and homebound
// legs either side of it — not a closed loop (the two Earth-side ends do not

// TerraGator's leg also needed reshaping, not just re-parking: Krittin,
// looking at the actual render, pointed out a wide empty gap between the

// that it could read as crossing it, and mEnter (near the Moon's top, where
// the outbound leg used to wrap in) sat close to Sky Crane. More radius pushes

// from the hero scene. The two launch vehicles are specific real ones at
// Krittin's request (shuttle, SLS).
//
// Every vehicle is built nose-up along local +Y with a total length of ~1, so
// aiming one along a trajectory is a single setFromUnitVectors plus the roll
// park() applies on top.
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------

// (finGeometry/finClones, which scattered flat triangular fins evenly around
// a body, went with the two generic rockets they existed for. Neither the
// shuttle nor SLS has radially repeated fins.)

// ---- the two launch vehicles -------------------------------------------
//
// Both replaced the generic finned rockets they used to be — Krittin: "make
// new models for terra and navigator, use spaceshuttle for terra and use SLS
// for Navigator (make new 3d model same style as other models)". So these are
// real vehicles now rather than two variations on a pencil, built in the same
// merged fill + hairline edge treatment as everything else here.
//
// BOTH HAVE A PREFERRED ROLL, which the old rockets did not. A finned tube
// reads the same from any angle, so park() could leave the roll wherever
// setFromUnitVectors happened to put it. A shuttle seen edge-on is a stick,
// and SLS with its two boosters hidden behind the core is just a tube — so
// park() now rolls each model about its own long axis to face the camera, and
// each is built with its identifying features in the local XY plane (the
// plane that roll points at the viewer). See park(), and TERRAGATOR_ROLL /
// NAVIGATOR_ROLL for the offset off exactly-broadside.

// Project TerraGator — the Space Shuttle orbiter. Nose-up along +Y like every
// other model here, so it sits on the outbound climb without special-casing.
//
// The delta planform IS the recognisable thing at this size, so the wings lie
// in the local XY plane and get the camera-facing roll; the vertical fin is

  //     anything (not the model not the earth nit the moon) if they overlap
  //     move them more to the side." UNVERIFIED — dx/dy are still a guess and

  // Three labels are NUDGED RIGHT by a prefix of their own text, which is how
  // Krittin specifies these: navigator "by distance as far as 'nav'",
  // terragator "as far as 'terra'", the CBF one by "no". All three are
  // centre-aligned, so shifting by N characters slides the text right by that
  // much while it stays centred on the new point.
  //
  // dx is in units of `unit` (see render()), so these are derived rather than
  // eyeballed: JetBrains Mono advances 0.6em, the labels are 16px, so one
  // character is 9.6px, and `unit` is ~740 on the reference 1440x740 canvas.

  // They therefore scale with the canvas rather than being fixed pixels,
  // which is the same reason every other offset here is a fraction.
  // `desc`/`img` feed the hover preview panel (.proj-info) — see
  // updateInfoPanel() below. None of the six have a real SUMMARY yet (a
  // sentence written for this card specifically would be fabricating one —
  // CLAUDE.md: never fabricate a project description), so `desc` is each
